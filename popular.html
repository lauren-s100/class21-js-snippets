    <h2>Popular Animal: Jeff the Giraffe</h2>

    <p>
      Our most popular animal is our friendly pal Jeff the Giraffe! Jeff uses his long neck to chomp down on leaves from
      tall trees or snacks from zookeepers all the way up on the observation platform. Don't be scared of Jeff's long
      tongue; if he licks you, that means he likes you!
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeff, like all giraffes, sleeps very little (&lt; 30 minutes a night) in make sure he is alert &amp; ready to
      avoid predators. No wonder he eats so much every day (&gt; 50 pounds [or 23 kilograms] of leaves)!

    <h2>Popular Animal: Sam the Snow Leopard</h2>

    <p>
      Sam is a recent addition to the Ithaca Zoo and we are thrilled to have her! She prefers her
      privacy and is most active in the mornings. She likes to eat sheep and goats, so be sure to
      leave your livestock at home. Sam is looking forward to winter in the Finger Lakes and hopes
      to see lots of snow.

    <p>
      Like many other big cats, Sam is an excellent acrobat. She can leap up to 30 feet (9 meters) in a single
      bound, so be sure to stay behind the protective glass lest you end up her lunch!
